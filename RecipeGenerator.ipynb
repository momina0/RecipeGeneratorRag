Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a large measuring cup, pressing on solids with a spoon to extract as much liquid as possible (you should have about 4 cups broth). Chill until ready to use.\nMeanwhile, cook noodles in a large pot of boiling salted water according to package directions. Drain and rinse under cold water. Cover with damp paper towels; set aside.\nSeason beaten eggs with remaining 1/4 tsp. salt. Melt butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add half of beaten eggs and swirl around skillet to make a thin egg crepe. Cook undisturbed until completely set, about 2 minutes. Slide egg crepe onto a cutting board. Repeat with remaining egg mixture, placing second egg crepe right on top of the first one. When cool enough to handle, tightly roll up eggs. Thinly slice crosswise to create long shreds.\nDivide noodles among bowls. Pour tomato broth over, holding back any foam. Arrange shredded eggs, cucumbers, scallions, and cilantro in bowls. Serve with hot chili paste alongside.\nDo Ahead: Tomato broth can be made 2 days ahead.
